# Hi there!

This is my first attempt at web development. Iâ€™ve been really interested in the capabilities of Three.js in web graphics, so I tried my hand at setting up a personal website. I tried to include a bit of everything I could (somewhat) wrap my head around: 3D models, vertex shaders, and animation. Definitely going to redesign the site significantly over the next few months as I start to understand fragment shaders and graphics rendering more.
For now, this is what I've got.

### Resources Used

The libraries, dev tools, and content creators that I relied on to write the site. 

* Three.js: 3D JavaScript library that was the motivtaion for the site 
* Vite: used to bundle project and optimize under-the-hood web dev stuff I don't understand
* Wael Yasmina: Three.js playlist was a massive help in so many interactive of the site
* Fireship: funny guy, check out hisThree.js starter template 
* DesignCourse: fantastic teacher of CSS and HTML basics
