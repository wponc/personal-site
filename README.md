Hi there!

This is my first attempt at web development. Iâ€™ve been really interested in the capabilities of Three.js in web graphics, so I tried my hand at setting up a personal website. I tried to include a bit of everything I could (somewhat) wrap my head around: 3D models, vertex shaders, and animation. Definitely going to redesign the site significantly over the next few months as I start to understand fragment shaders and graphics rendering more.
For now, this is what I've got.
